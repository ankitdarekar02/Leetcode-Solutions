We write the integers of A and B (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

Now, we may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers A[i] and B[j] such that:

A[i] == B[j];
The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.
Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each number can only belong to one connecting line.

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

Input: A = [2,5,1,2,5], B = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
Output: 3

Input: A = [1,3,7,1,7,5], B = [1,9,2,5,1]
Output: 2
